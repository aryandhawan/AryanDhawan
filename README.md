## Hi there 👋 I am Aryan Dhawan/
Welcome to my GitHub profile!
I’m an aspiring AI/ML engineer from Ahmedabad, Gujarat, India, passionate about building intelligent solutions and eager to gain real-world experience through internships.

 About Me
 AI/ML Enthusiast: I’m fascinated by the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning to solve complex, real-world problems.

💡 Driven Learner: I’m constantly exploring new technologies, algorithms, and best practices in AI/ML.

 Hands-On Creator: I love turning ideas into working code, whether a simple GUI app or a scalable AI-powered solution.

 Currently Seeking: Internship opportunities where I can apply my skills, learn from experienced mentors, and contribute to impactful projects.

🏆 What Motivates Me
Curiosity: I’m always eager to learn, experiment, and discover new ways to make technology work smarter.

Growth: I value feedback and mentorship and am committed to continuous improvement.

Teamwork: I enjoy collaborating with others, sharing knowledge, and building solutions together.

 My Tech Stack
Languages: Python, C language, HTML, CSS

Frameworks/Libraries: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, (DL is a much deeper subject, so TensorFlow and PyTorch are still in progress.)

Tools: Jupyter, Git and web-scraping 

 Featured Projects
Project Name: CryptoSense- this is my first AI/ML-based project to solve a real-world problem that helps to predict the market trends in cryptocurrency. This uses a RandomForest classifier Model for prediction.

Project Name: Workforce-attrition predictor- this is my project used to predict, based on HR data, how much of the actual workforce can be replaced by AI, and it uses the Logistic Regression model with ElasticNet penalty, and this has been hypertuned with the GridSearchCV

🤝 Let’s Connect!
🌟 Open to Internship Opportunities: Especially in AI/ML, data science, or software development.

 Let’s Collaborate: I’m excited to work on challenging projects and learn from experienced teams.
